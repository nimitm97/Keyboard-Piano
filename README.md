# Introduction

This project aims at replicating the Piano on to a laptop/computer keyboard. There are many nuances which can be achieved easily with this conversion. For example, instead of learning the Chords in the form of which keys to play and then master them flawlessly on a piano, one could simply use Shift + 'A' for example to play A major.
Also, instead of learning piano notations and remembering them while playing a song, one could just convert them into alphabetical notations and type. As we know typing speed is on average quite good as compared to playing a piano note, hence even a novice can play this keyboard-piano.

The idea is to expand the project and convert it into a web application so that anyone could easily play the piano in its full length along with chords.
